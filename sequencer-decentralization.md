# Sequencer Decentralization	feat: create sequencer decentralization analysis file
Sequencers order Layer 2 transactions before submission to Ethereum.
## Current Model
Many Layer 2 networks operate with a single centralized sequencer.
## Centralization Risks
- Transaction censorship
- Downtime risk
## Mitigation Strategies
Projects are exploring shared sequencers and proof-of-efficiency.
