# Infrastructure Projects on Base
Infrastructure includes tools and services that enable application development and network operation.
Examples:
- RPC providers
- Indexing services
- Analytics platforms
- Developer tooling
Infrastructure is critical for ecosystem scalability.
## Infrastructure Observations
Infrastructure reliability directly influences user experience.
Centralized providers currently dominate RPC access.
## Decentralization Outlook
Infrastructure decentralization remains an ongoing challenge.
